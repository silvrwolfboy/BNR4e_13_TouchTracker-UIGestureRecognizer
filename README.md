## TouchTracker app 
- this chapter builds upon the functionality of the previous chapter's TouchTracker app. 
- strokes can be selected and deleted via a menu-item
- double tapping the background clears the screen
- a long press selects a stroke, which can then be moved

### This chapter covers : 
Usage of the following classes: 

- UITapGestureRecognizer 
- UILongPressGestureRecognizer
- UIPanGestureRecognizer 
- UIMenuController

The following concepts : 

- handling multiple gestures, which may interfere with one another. 
- sharing touches with other gestures.  For instance, the pan gesture in this app occurs within the context of a single very long press.
